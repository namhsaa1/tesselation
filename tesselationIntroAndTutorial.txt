Intro:
For every discrete matrix, there exists a continuous tessellation function T(x, y) that:
Matches the original matrix at all integer row and column positions.
Provides smooth values for non-integer positions between the rows and columns.
Can be constructed using Lagrange (polynomial) interpolation or Fourier (sine/cosine wave) interpolation.
This allows a matrix to be extended into a smooth surface, useful for interpolation, visualization, and signal processing.

Tutorial:
To tesselate a matrix M[i,j] (0 ≤ i ≤ n, 0 ≤ j ≤ m) (M is a n x m matrix)
you can use Lagrangian Interpolation:

T(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^m M[i,j] · L_i(x) · L_j(y)

where

L_i(x) = \prod_{p=0, p≠i}^n (x - p) / (i - p)

L_j(y) = \prod_{q=0, q≠j}^m (y - q) / (j - q)

this returns you a polynomial where 

M[i,j] = T(i,j)


OR

you can use Fourier Interpolation:

T(x,y) = \sum_{p=0}^{N-1} \sum_{q=0}^{M-1} C_{p,q} \, \exp\Big( 2 \pi i \, \Big( \frac{p x}{N} + \frac{q y}{M} \Big) \Big)

where

C_{p,q} = \frac{1}{N M} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \sum_{j=0}^{M-1} M[i,j] \,\exp\Big( - 2 \pi i \, \Big( \frac{p i}{N} + \frac{q j}{M} \Big) \Big)

this returns you a trigonometric polynomial where

M[i,j] = T(i,j)


SUPER IMPORTANT

THIS ALLOWS YOU TO "ROTATE" A MATRIX (IN 2 AXES), A DETERMINANT (IN 2 AXES)

IF YOU HAVE A MATRIX A, N*M, AND TESSELATE IT 

I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO COMPREHENSIBLY EXPLAIN THIS BUT IF YOU CAN CONSTRUCT MATRIX A FROM THE MATCHING INDICES AND THEN REPLACE THE FUNCTION WITH THE FUNCTION ROTATED X DEGREES THEN YOU CAN REMAP THE MATRIX TO A ROTATED MATRIX WHICH YOU CAN DETERMINE AND GET A ROTATED MATRIX AND A ROTATED DETERMINANT AND THERES A WAY TO COMPLEX DETERMINE IT ILL WRITE IT ONCE I GET HOME BYE BYE GUYS
