For every discrete matrix, there exists a continuous tessellation function T(x, y) that:

Matches the original matrix at all integer row and column positions.

Provides smooth values for non-integer positions between the rows and columns.

Can be constructed using Lagrange (polynomial) interpolation or Fourier (sine/cosine wave) interpolation.

This allows a matrix to be extended into a smooth surface, useful for interpolation, visualization, and signal processing.
