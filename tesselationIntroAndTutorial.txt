Intro:
For every discrete matrix, there exists a continuous tessellation function T(x, y) that:
Matches the original matrix at all integer row and column positions.
Provides smooth values for non-integer positions between the rows and columns.
Can be constructed using Lagrange (polynomial) interpolation or Fourier (sine/cosine wave) interpolation.
This allows a matrix to be extended into a smooth surface, useful for interpolation, visualization, and signal processing.

Tutorial:
To tesselate a matrix M[i,j] (0 ≤ i ≤ n, 0 ≤ j ≤ m) (M is a n x m matrix)
you can use Lagrangian Interpolation:

T(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^m M[i,j] · L_i(x) · L_j(y)

where

L_i(x) = \prod_{p=0, p≠i}^n (x - p) / (i - p)

L_j(y) = \prod_{q=0, q≠j}^m (y - q) / (j - q)

this returns you a polynomial where 

M[i,j] = T(i,j)
