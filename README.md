Matrix Tesselation is a function that you derive from a Matrix that allows you to pseudo-index into negative, non-integer, and imaginary entries of the Matrix. For every discrete matrix M, there exists a continous function T(i,j) where T(i,j) = M[i,j]. There can be multiple Matrix Tesselations per Matrix, and you can find tesselations by using Lagrange (polynomial) Interpolation or/and Fourier (wave) interpolation.
